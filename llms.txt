# Project Name:
Wellness Points App

# Description:
A secure and minimal Rails app where users sign up via email/password, add "Allies" by email, and assign points to them for completing healthy or meaningful tasks. Users can later connect a wallet to claim their points as onchain tokens (future phase).

# Core Concepts:
- Every user can give and receive points.
- Points are assigned only to authorized users ("Allies") the user has added.
- Each point assignment includes a task description and value.
- Future integration will allow claiming points to tokens via connected wallet.

# Models:
## User
- Devise-authenticated (email/password)
- username:string
- wallet_address:string (optional)
- Relationships:
  - has_many :allies
  - has_many :sent_transactions (as giver)
  - has_many :received_transactions (as receiver)

## Ally
- user:references (the one assigning points)
- ally_email:string (email of recipient user, even if not signed up yet)
- Validations:
  - Cannot add yourself
  - Valid email format

## PointTransaction
- giver:references → User
- receiver:references → User
- task:string
- points:integer
- claimed:boolean (default: false)
- claimed_at:timestamp
- Validations:
  - Cannot give points to yourself
  - Must match an existing Ally relationship

# Permissions & Rules:
- Only signed-in users can access app
- Users can only assign points to Allies they've added
- Users can only view their own given/received points
- Claiming points to tokens requires wallet connection (future)

# Frontend Plan:
- ERB with Turbo Streams (optional React later)
- Dashboard with 2 tabs:
  - Tab 1: Assign Points (to Allies)
  - Tab 2: View Received Points (feed of point history)

# Technology Stack:
- Ruby on Rails
- PostgreSQL
- Devise
- ERB/Turbo or React
- Deployment target: Fly.io / Render
- Local: PostgreSQL + Rails server

# Phase 2:
- Wallet connection flow (Ethereum, Base)
- Onchain token minting or claim flow
- Token claim audit trail and rate limiting
